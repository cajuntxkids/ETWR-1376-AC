  <h1>Organizational Background – Digital Neighbor: Digital Literacy for Seniors</h1>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Digital Neighbor: Digital Literacy for Seniors began in May 2023 as a small volunteer initiative aimed at helping older adults in Central Texas feel more confident navigating the digital world. What started as informal one-on-one tech help — teaching seniors how to use their phones, access email, or connect with family over video chat — quickly grew into something much larger and more impactful.</p>
  <p>As more companies and organizations shift to a digital world, it’s easy to miss many seniors feeling left behind as essential parts of life move online. From banking and telehealth to grocery shopping and connecting with loved ones, the lack of digital skills among older adults often leads to isolation, frustration, and even vulnerability to scams.</p>
  <p>Angie Creel, the program’s founder, saw this firsthand through her work in the community and began organizing structured support sessions, easy-to-follow printed guides, and friendly “house calls” for seniors who couldn't travel.</p>
  <p>Today, Digital Neighbor: Digital Literacy for Seniors is developing into a full-scale nonprofit organization dedicated to bridging the digital divide for older adults. The program focuses on hands-on workshops, one-on-one mentoring through intergenerational partnerships, and a growing pilot for in-home tech training. Printed guides, accessible language, and patient instruction make the learning experience senior-friendly and judgment-free. One unique feature of the program is its ability to bring services directly to seniors, whether they live in rural areas, assisted living communities, or private homes.</p>
  <p>The initiative is also building partnerships with local libraries, retirement communities, schools, and other community organizations. Potential collaborators include community tech access programs, broadband partners, and senior-focused organizations like AARP and Meals on Wheels.</p>
  <p>In its first year, Digital Neighbor: Digital Literacy for Seniors has helped more than 50 older adults build confidence in using devices while providing refurbished tablets and smartphones to those without access. Though the numbers are small, word of mouth and distributed flyers are already expanding our reach, and we expect these numbers to grow. Many seniors in nursing homes and retirement communities often feel isolated and forgotten, and our organization is dedicated to making it easier for them to stay connected and maintain their independence. With formal nonprofit status on the horizon, we are focused on building a diverse board and securing funding to continue growing our impact.</p>

  <h2>Programs</h2>
  <h3>Senior Tech 101</h3>
  <p>A beginner-friendly workshop series that walks seniors through the basics of using smartphones, tablets, and computers. Topics include how to make calls (including FaceTime), send texts and emails, use search engines, download apps, and adjust accessibility settings (like larger fonts or voice commands). These sessions are designed to build confidence through repetition, patience, and real-life examples.</p>
  <h3>Click &amp; Connect</h3>
  <p>A mentorship program that pairs seniors with tech-savvy volunteers—often students or younger community members. The goal is to create lasting, supportive relationships where seniors can get individualized help while also building social connections. This program also helps bridge generational gaps and fosters mutual respect and learning.</p>
  <h3>Community Tech Corners</h3>
  <p>Pop-up learning spaces set up in senior centers, libraries, churches, and community halls. These spaces provide devices, Wi-Fi access, and printed how-to guides for seniors to practice at their own pace. Volunteer instructors are available during certain hours to answer questions or help troubleshoot. These hubs offer a low-pressure, social way to learn.</p>
  <h3>Safe Surfing (Pilot)</h3>
  <p>An online safety course created specifically for older adults, focusing on common scams, phishing emails, identity protection, and recognizing misinformation. The program includes real-world examples, role-playing, and take-home resources. The goal is to reduce fear and confusion around internet use, empowering seniors to confidently and safely navigate the digital world.</p>
  <h3>Tech at Home (Pilot)</h3>
  <p>A developing program that brings digital literacy instruction directly into the homes of seniors who face mobility issues, transportation challenges, or live in more remote areas. Volunteers or part-time staff visit homes to provide training, assess needs, and help with device setup. This program ensures no senior is excluded due to physical limitations or geographic barriers.</p>
