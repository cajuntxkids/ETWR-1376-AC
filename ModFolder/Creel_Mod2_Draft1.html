<h1>Statement of Problem(s) – Digital Neighbor: Digital Literacy for Seniors</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Digital Neighbor: Digital Literacy for Seniors</strong> is a community-based initiative founded in May 2023 by Angie Creel in Central Texas. The program emerged in response to a growing need among older adults—particularly those in rural and underserved areas—who struggle to keep up in an increasingly digital world. Angie’s firsthand experiences helping seniors with basic tasks like accessing email, using video calls, or navigating healthcare portals inspired the creation of this volunteer-led effort.</p>

<p>The organization’s mission is to help seniors confidently use technology to stay connected, access essential services, and maintain independence. Rooted in values of inclusivity, patience, accessibility, and intergenerational collaboration, Digital Neighbor offers practical, hands-on support that empowers older adults to participate in modern life.</p>

<p>Key programs include <em>Senior Tech 101</em> (device basics), <em>Click &amp; Connect</em> (mentorship with youth volunteers), <em>Community Tech Corners</em> (pop-up learning spaces), <em>Safe Surfing</em> (online safety education), and the <em>Tech at Home</em> pilot (in-home instruction for seniors with mobility limitations). In its first year, the program supported over 50 seniors, provided refurbished devices to individuals lacking access, and built partnerships with libraries, schools, and senior-focused organizations.</p>

<p>Digital Neighbor is currently guided by a small, dedicated team of volunteers with backgrounds in technology, education, and communications. The organization currently relies on a core team of under half a dozen volunteers who contribute regularly to instruction, outreach, and program development. Plans are underway to build a diverse board and bring on part-time staff as the organization seeks 501(c)(3) nonprofit status and funding to expand.</p>

<p>What sets Digital Neighbor apart is its ability to meet seniors where they are, both literally and figuratively, through in-home training, personalized instruction, and meaningful relationships that reduce isolation and foster digital confidence. With strong community roots, adaptable programming, and a proven record of impact, Digital Neighbor is well-positioned to grow and bridge the digital divide for older adults across Central Texas.</p>

<h2>Who? Where? When?</h2>
<p><strong>Who is in need?</strong><br>
Older adults (primarily 60+) in Central Texas—especially in rural areas, assisted living facilities, and low-income neighborhoods.</p>

<p><strong>Where are they?</strong><br>
They are in need of basic digital literacy training and access to devices.</p>

<p><strong>When is the problem evident?</strong><br>
The problem is ongoing and has been especially visible since the COVID-19 pandemic, when many essential services moved online.</p>

<h2>What? Why?</h2>
<p><strong>What is the problem?</strong><br>
The problem is digital exclusion: many seniors do not have the skills or access needed to use technology for communication, healthcare, or basic services.</p>

<p><strong>Why does this problem exist?</strong><br>
This exists due to generational gaps in tech familiarity, mobility issues, affordability, and limited outreach efforts to seniors.</p>

<h2>Evidence of Problem</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.aarp.org/pri/topics/technology/internet-media-devices/2024-technology-trends-older-adults/" target="_blank">AARP’s 2023 Technology Trends report</a>, 64% of adults aged 50 and over believe that technology is not designed with their age group in mind. This suggests that a significant portion of older adults feel disconnected from the fast-paced changes in digital tools and platforms. As technology continues to evolve rapidly, seniors often find themselves excluded from services and opportunities that require digital proficiency.</p>

<p>Digital Neighbor has already served over 50 older adults and witnessed these challenges firsthand. Many seniors struggle with what might seem like simple tasks — such as sending text messages, scheduling telehealth appointments, or identifying online scams — because the tools are unfamiliar, overwhelming, or not intuitive for older users. This lived experience reinforces the urgent need for accessible, age-friendly digital education and support.</p>

<h2>Impact If Problems Resolved</h2>
<p><strong>What will occur if needs are met?</strong><br>
Seniors will become more confident and independent. They will be able to connect with family, access services like telehealth, manage finances, and reduce social isolation.</p>

<p><strong>How is the problem linked to your organization?</strong><br>
Digital Neighbor addresses this issue directly through personalized, patient instruction and by bringing services to seniors where they are—something few others do in this region.</p>
