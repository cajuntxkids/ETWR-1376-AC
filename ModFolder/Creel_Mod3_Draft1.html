<h1>Digital Neighbor: Digital Literacy for Seniors</h1>

<h2>Goals and Objectives Summary</h2>
<p>At Digital Neighbor, our goal is pretty simple: we want to help seniors feel at home in today's digital world. Too often, older adults get left behind as more and more of life moves online. We're here to change that by helping them build confidence with technology, connect with essential services, and stay independent for as long as possible.</p>
<p>To get there, we're focusing on real, hands-on support. We offer workshops that teach the basics, pair seniors with younger mentors who can walk with them step-by-step, and bring tech help directly into seniors' homes when they can't easily get out. We'll keep track of our progress by counting how many seniors we reach and how many devices we provide and using simple surveys to see how much confidence and skill our participants gain along the way.</p>
<p>Success looks like a senior who can video call their grandkids, schedule a telehealth appointment without stress, or feel safer navigating the internet. We're setting a first goal of reaching at least 100 seniors in the next year — because every single connection we make truly matters.</p>

<h2>Goals and Objectives Review Questions</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Are the goals stated as results? And do they relate to the problem statement?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. Getting results is the main focus of my goals. Here, the main goal is to help seniors gain confidence using technology so they can stay connected, access services, and live more independently. These goals tie directly to the problem statement, which identifies digital exclusion as a growing barrier for older adults in Central Texas.</dd>

  <dt>Are the outcome objectives stated as results that relate to a program goal? Are they stepping stones to achieving success (the goal)? Can everyone understand them?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. The objectives, like hosting Senior Tech 101 workshops, establishing mentorships through Click & Connect, and my personal favorite, providing in-home training, all serve as clear, understandable stepping stones toward achieving the overall goal.</dd>

  <dt>Can progress in meeting the objectives be measured and assessed?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. We are already tracking our progress by recording how many seniors participate in programs, how many devices we distribute, and how many mentoring matches we make. Moving forward, I plan to add simple surveys before and after participation to measure skills improvement and confidence growth.</dd>

  <dt>Do the objectives describe the population and a specific time frame for change?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, they are. We are growing gradually, leveraging volunteers, partnerships, and modest funding requests to expand our capacity without overextending ourselves. I have also structured the activities to allow scaling based on the funding and volunteers available.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Strategies Summary</h2>
<p>At Digital Neighbor, our strategies are simple — we go where the seniors are and give them the kind of help that feels personal, not overwhelming.</p>
<p>We run hands-on workshops (Senior Tech 101) where seniors can practice everything from sending a text to using FaceTime. We connect them with younger volunteers through our Click & Connect mentorship program because we know that a little patience — and a friendly face — makes a huge difference. We also pop up in community spaces with our Tech Corners so seniors can drop in, practice, and ask questions without feeling rushed. And when seniors can't make it out, we bring the help to them through our Tech at Home program.</p>
<p>We picked these strategies because they solve the real problems we see: transportation struggles, feeling left behind, and technology, which is just plain confusing. We'll start by growing our workshops and pop-up spaces first, then work on expanding the at-home support later this year. Volunteers with backgrounds in teaching, tech, and community work will help lead the way. We've built a plan that's realistic for where we are right now — and flexible enough to keep growing as we bring more people on board.</p>

<h2>Strategies Review Questions</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Do the strategies discussed in the proposal derive logically from the problem statement and the goals and objectives?</dt>
  <dd>Absolutely. Each strategy addresses the needs highlighted in the problem statement.</dd>

  <dt>Do the strategies present the program activities to be undertaken?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, they do. I’ve clearly outlined activities like workshops, mentorship programs, pop-up learning hubs, online safety classes, and at-home tech instruction.</dd>

  <dt>Has the grantseeker explained why they selected the specific strategies or activities?</dt>
  <dd>I have explained it somewhat, but I realize I could make it even stronger. I chose these strategies because seniors often need very personal, patient, and accessible help.</dd>

  <dt>Has the grantseeker explained the timing and order of the specific activities?</dt>
  <dd>I plan to start by expanding Senior Tech 101 workshops in the first quarter, then grow Community Tech Corners in the second quarter, while continuously recruiting and training mentors year-round. Scaling the Tech at Home pilot will depend on volunteer and funding capacity, but we anticipate mid- to late-year expansion.</dd>

  <dt>Is it clear who will perform specific activities? And do their credentials and/or experience demonstrate that they are appropriate to carry out the activities of the program?</dt>
  <dd>Somewhat. I have a small, experienced team of volunteers with backgrounds in technology, education, and community outreach. Moving forward, I’ll highlight that our volunteers include retired educators, IT specialists, and trained student interns.</dd>

  <dt>Given the organization’s projected resources, are the proposed activities feasible?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. We are growing gradually, leveraging volunteers, partnerships, and modest funding to expand capacity without overextending ourselves.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Evaluation Summary</h2>
<p>At Digital Neighbor, making a difference means more than just offering programs — it means making sure they actually help the people we serve.</p>
<p>We’ll keep things simple but meaningful when it comes to evaluation. We’ll track how many seniors join our workshops, how many devices we provide, and we’ll ask seniors to share how confident they feel using technology before and after working with us. Surveys and a few simple questions will tell us what's working and where we can improve. Mentors and coordinators will help collect and review results to guide changes.</p>
<p>We’ll use everything we learn to make our programs even stronger. At the end of the day, success means seeing a senior book a telehealth appointment, video call their grandkids, or spot a scam before it causes harm. If we make technology feel less scary and more empowering, we know we’re doing something right.</p>

<h2>Evaluation Review Questions</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Does the evaluation section focus on assessing the project results?</dt>
  <dd>Not fully yet, but I am building it into the plan. I will measure project results by tracking participation, device distributions, and surveys that gauge skills and confidence.</dd>

  <dt>Does it explain how the evaluation will assess the efficiency of program methods?</dt>
  <dd>It will. We will assess participation, satisfaction, and repeat engagement, and adjust programming as needed.</dd>

  <dt>Does it describe who will be evaluated and what will be measured?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. Seniors will be evaluated on tech confidence, task completion, and satisfaction.</dd>

  <dt>Does it specify what information will be collected in the evaluation process?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. Attendance records, device distributions, surveys, and mentor feedback will be collected.</dd>

  <dt>Does it state who will be responsible for making the assessments?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. Program coordinators, volunteers, and staff will oversee assessment.</dd>

  <dt>Does it discuss how the information and conclusions will be used to improve the program?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. Feedback will be used to refine training, mentorship, and support services to better meet seniors' needs.</dd>

  <dt>Does it provide the organization’s definition of success?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. Success means seniors feel confident using technology independently and stay connected to important services and loved ones.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Sustainability Summary</h2>
<p>At Digital Neighbor, we’re building something we hope lasts well beyond this first grant. We know the need for digital help for seniors isn't going away anytime soon.</p>
<p>Applying for grants, working with tech businesses and senior groups, and organizing local fundraisers are just a few of the ways we’re making sure the program stays strong. We’re also encouraging device donations to help stretch resources, and in the future, we may offer advanced classes for a small fee to help cover costs without putting pressure on seniors who need basic services.</p>
<p>While this initial funding will give us a much-needed boost, we’re thinking ahead. Our commitment is to build a strong foundation now, so Digital Neighbor can grow and thrive independently over time — relying less and less on outside funding.</p>

<h2>Sustainability Review Questions</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Is it the organization’s intent to have the program continue after the initial grant funding is gone?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. We intend for Digital Neighbor to become a permanent part of community support for seniors.</dd>

  <dt>If yes, does the sustainability component of the proposal present a plan for securing future funding for the program?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. We will pursue grants, sponsorships, device donations, and community events to secure future funding.</dd>

  <dt>Does it discuss future funding strategies or earned-income strategies?</dt>
  <dd>Yes. In the future, we may offer advanced tech classes for a fee to help support the program's growth.</dd>

  <dt>If the organization is requesting a multiyear grant, did it show that the organization will have a decreasing reliance on grant support each year?</dt>
  <dd>Not applicable at this time, but if we pursue a multiyear grant, we plan to show a decreasing need for grant funding as local partnerships and earned income grow.</dd>
